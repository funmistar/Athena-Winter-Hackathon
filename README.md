To run the Sparents app, open the ‚ÄúFinal‚Äù Branch‚Äù and run the ‚Äúslope.py‚Äù file. Please ensure you install all of the relevant dependencies.

To Run the task/to do list, open the ‚Äútask_list_screen‚Äù Branch and run the ‚Äúmain.py‚Äù file.  Please ensure you install all of the relevant dependencies.


# Inspiration
Life during lockdown has been difficult for everyone, however, a group that are largely ignored are working parents, specifically working mums. 35% of working mothers have lost work or work fewer hours due to lack of childcare support during the pandemic. This has led to a widening gender gap. American Progress conducted a report which estimates that the risk of mothers leaving the labor force and reducing work hours (in order to assume caretaking responsibilities) amounts to $64.5 billion per year in lost wages and economic activity.
 
Therefore focusing on this struggle, we wanted to streamline the process of arranging childcare arrangements. Sparents is an online platform where parents can collaborate and network with other parents to distribute childcare. It is essentially modernising and digitalising the ‚Äúit takes a village to raise a child‚Äù principe, as emphasised by our slogan ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get stressed, get community‚Äù. Users can be either Parents, helpers or both. Helpers are anyone in the community willing to help others out, they can offer a range of services ranging from babysitting, nannying to tutoring or guitar lessons.

# How we built it

Our stack is made of Python, SQLite3, Kivy and KivyMD. We created a Figma prototype to detail the layout of the screens. From there we created some of the most prominent screens of the App design into Kivy files. We utilised a Kivy screen manager to allow us to seamlessly transition between screens. We created a callback function which would allow us to implement more complex design layouts such as Chips.


# Challenges we faced-
Due to unforeseen circumstances, two of the members in our team had to drop out over the course of the weekend. This led to a re-scoping of our project since we had to reorganise the workload and consider the skills and capabilities of the remaining members. We had hopes of providing some more backend functionality before the deadline but the demo below shows an example of how our app would interact with sql databases e.g. through keeping track of the user‚Äôs tasks (very useful for busy parents!). Aside from this, we had to overcome some obstacles as we stumbled our way through using KivyMD, such as: handling transitions between different screens through screen manager, understanding and implementing CSS-type logic, and linking this UI to a database. Despite all the challenges, this was an enjoyable experience and we learned a lot along the way :)

What we learned & achieved- 
How to create a satisfactory business plan with consideration of the current market and climate, the competition, USP etc
How to adapt to changes within the team
How to work well together by identifying individual strengths and skills, keeping up regular communication, and keeping it fun!
How to create an interactive UI using KivyMD
How to create a fully fledged prototype in Figma and experience this process from scratch.

To the ShowCode Judges ü§¶
We needed to create the Final Branch because despite uploading everything before the deadline, we later discovered that due to an empty file in our directory, Github had only uploaded half of the relevant files. This meant to many of the files which were needed such as the slop.py were not in the Main branch.
